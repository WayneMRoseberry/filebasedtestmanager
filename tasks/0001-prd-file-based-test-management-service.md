# PRD: File Based Test Management Service

## Introduction/Overview

The File Based Test Management Service addresses the critical limitations of existing test management solutions by providing a flexible, file-system-based approach to organizing and managing test collateral. Unlike rigid database solutions that force structure and suffer from slow UI performance, this service allows testers to store collateral in any format while providing easy discovery, reporting, and aggregation capabilities.

**Problem Statement:** Managing test collateral (plans, requirements, ideas, sessions, cases, data, and results) is difficult with existing solutions that force limiting structure, have slow UIs, and require expensive per-use licenses in walled garden systems.

**Solution:** A file system-based collateral management solution that allows flexible storage of test collateral in any format while offering easy reporting, collection, and aggregation of testing activity.

## Goals

1. **Flexible Storage**: Enable test collateral to exist in any format from any application
2. **File System Organization**: Implement hierarchical file system structure for test collateral management
3. **Manifest-Based Discovery**: Create manifest files that describe and point to actual test collateral
4. **Fast Performance**: Deliver responsive API and UI performance for efficient test management
5. **Windows Compatibility**: Ensure full functionality on Windows platform (primary requirement)
6. **Individual and Small Team Focus**: Optimize for individual testers and small testing teams (2-10 people)

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a tester**, I want to organize my test collateral in folders so that I can find things quickly and maintain a logical structure for my testing work.

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a test manager**, I want to generate reports on testing progress so that I can track project status and communicate with stakeholders
- **As a team member**, I want to browse test collateral in a structured way so that I can understand what testing has been done
- **As a tester**, I want to create manifest files that describe my test collateral so that the system can automatically discover and organize my work
- **As a project lead**, I want to see an overview of all testing activities so that I can understand project coverage and progress

## Functional Requirements

### 1. File System Structure
1.1. The system must support a root directory structure where all test collateral resides
1.2. The system must allow hierarchical organization of test collateral within the file system
1.3. The system must support any file format for test collateral storage
1.4. The system must initially focus on text-based formats (.txt, .md, .json) with expansion capability

### 2. Manifest File System
2.1. The system must support a main test manifest file that describes the overall project
2.2. The system must support multiple projects within the same directory structure
2.3. The system must support additive manifest files that extend the main manifest
2.4. The system must require each manifest file to indicate which project it belongs to

### 3. Manifest Schema Support
3.1. The system must support Projects with name, start date, and area hierarchy properties
3.2. The system must support Test Strategies that describe testing plans for projects
3.3. The system must support Test Plans that describe test collateral for specific project areas
3.4. The system must support Test Charters that describe specific testing missions and refer to detailed documents
3.5. The system must support Test Sessions with charter references, date/time/length, executor, and product revision
3.6. The system must support Test Session Reports that align metadata with their corresponding test sessions
3.7. The system must support Test Suites as collections of test cases
3.8. The system must support Test Cases as specific testing ideas associated with test charters
3.9. The system must support Test Status Reports as project-level testing summaries

### 4. API Discovery and Reporting
4.1. The system must provide a `getProjects()` API that returns an array of all projects
4.2. The system must provide a `getProject()` API that returns project description with feature tree
4.3. The system must provide a `getTestStrategies()` API that returns test strategies for a given project
4.4. The system must provide a `getTestStrategy()` API that returns a specific test strategy object
4.5. The system must provide a `getTestPlans()` API with project and optional strategy filtering
4.6. The system must provide a `getTestCharters()` API with project and optional strategy/plan filtering
4.7. The system must provide a `getTestSessions()` API with project, charter, date, and revision filtering
4.8. The system must provide a `getTestReports()` API with project, session/charter, date, and revision filtering

### 5. Web-Based UI
5.1. The system must provide a web interface for browsing areas, strategies, plans, charters, sessions, and reports
5.2. The system must allow users to search test collateral by keywords, tags, date, product version, and author
5.3. The system must provide filtering capabilities based on collateral type
5.4. The system must provide a settings page for configuring service behaviors
5.5. The system must allow users to configure root directories for manifest file discovery

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

The following features are explicitly **NOT** included in the initial version:

- **User Authentication and Permissions**: No user management, login, or access control
- **Real-time Collaboration**: No live editing, shared workspaces, or concurrent user features
- **Advanced Reporting and Analytics**: No complex dashboards, metrics, or data visualization beyond basic reports
- **Integration with External Tools**: No connections to Jira, TestRail, or other test management systems
- **Cross-platform Priority**: While Windows is required, Mac/Linux support is not critical for initial release
- **Binary File Format Support**: Initial focus on text-based formats only

## Design Considerations

- **File System Navigation**: UI should provide intuitive folder browsing similar to file explorers
- **Search Interface**: Simple search bar with filter options for different metadata types
- **Manifest Editor**: Basic text editor for creating and editing manifest files
- **Project Overview**: Clean, hierarchical view of project structure and testing activities
- **Performance Focus**: UI should prioritize speed and responsiveness over visual complexity

## Technical Considerations

- **Windows Compatibility**: Must run reliably on Windows 10/11 platforms
- **File System Access**: Requires read/write access to local file system
- **Manifest Parsing**: Need robust JSON/YAML parsing for manifest files
- **API Framework**: RESTful API design for easy integration and testing
- **Web Framework**: Lightweight web framework for UI (consider Electron for desktop app)
- **Database**: No external database required - file system serves as data store

## Success Metrics

- **System Performance**: API response times under 200ms for standard queries
- **UI Responsiveness**: Page load times under 2 seconds for typical browsing operations
- **File Discovery**: Successfully parse and organize 95% of valid manifest files
- **User Adoption**: Track number of projects created and manifest files generated
- **Error Rate**: Less than 1% of API calls result in errors

## Open Questions

1. **Manifest File Format**: Should we standardize on JSON, YAML, or support both formats?
2. **File Watching**: Should the system automatically detect changes to manifest files, or require manual refresh?
3. **Backup Strategy**: How should users backup their test collateral and manifest files?
4. **Version Control**: Should the system integrate with Git for versioning test collateral?
5. **Performance Optimization**: For large projects with many files, what caching strategies should be implemented?
6. **Error Handling**: How should the system handle corrupted or invalid manifest files?
7. **Migration Path**: How can users migrate from existing test management tools to this system?
