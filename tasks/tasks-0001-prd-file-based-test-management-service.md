### Notes

- **TDD Approach**: Every implementation task MUST start with writing unit tests first (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.js` and `MyComponent.test.js` in the same directory)
- Use `npm test` to run all tests. Use `npm test -- --grep "specific test name"` to run specific tests
- **Test-First Workflow**: 
  1. Write failing test (Red)
  2. Write minimal code to pass test (Green) 
  3. Refactor while keeping tests green (Refactor)
  4. Repeat
- The project supports two deployment modes:
  - **Desktop App**: Electron-based local application for individual users
  - **Web Server**: Express-based server for team deployments
- Both modes share the same core API and UI code, with different entry points and packaging
